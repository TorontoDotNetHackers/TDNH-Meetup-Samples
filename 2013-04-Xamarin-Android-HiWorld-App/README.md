2013-04-Xamarin-Android-HiWorld-App
===================================

A sample Android App built using Xamarin tools in C#/.NET.  We took the Xamarin sample app, added a progress bar circular animation that starts on button click and bound an array of strings to a list view. 

Built on Windows 7 64-bit using Xamarin.Android Starter bundle and Xamarin Studio (included in the bundle).
