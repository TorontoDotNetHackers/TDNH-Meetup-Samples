.NET Programming - May 2012 Theme: Interfaces

GROUP CODING GOAL: We'll create an "information pipeline" (textual) by having some people implement an interface that takes input of the previous person, adds to that information or transforms it in some manner,and then passes it onto the next.

Other people can work on creating the pipeline itself into which everbody's implementations will be plugged. 

* TASK A- Implement the IInformation Interface: Individual Task - You will write code that takes the input from the previous person (you won't know who it is) and either transform the text in some fancy manner, or add to it. If you choose to add to the information you might, for example, query a web service  (e.g. The Weather Network to add the current weather report), or scrape some news from a news website, etc.  You can explore any .NET technology that interests you in order to obtain information to transform the flow.  Implement the interface as many times as you wish with various ideas.

* TASK B - Create the pipeline: This is a collaborative task. The pipeline will need to dynamically load assemblies provided by implementers of the IInformation interface, use some .NET Reflection techniques and start the information flowing.  At the end we'll display the result.
